Placeholder for classroom views.
Views to be implemented in Phase 2 Task #10.

All views that need to be implemented should use the license requirement mixins:
- @license_required('classroom') decorator for function-based views
- LicenseRequiredMixin or StaffLicenseRequiredMixin for class-based views

Example:
    from apps.licensing.mixins import StaffLicenseRequiredMixin
    from django.views.generic import TemplateView

    class DashboardView(StaffLicenseRequiredMixin, TemplateView):
        license_feature = 'classroom'
        template_name = 'classroom/dashboard.html'
