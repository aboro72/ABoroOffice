## 🎯 Immediate Next Action

Celery Tasks are complete! Continue with **Priority 3: Views & API**

```bash
# 1. Create views and URL routing
# apps/approvals/views.py - ApprovalListView, DetailView, etc.
# apps/approvals/urls.py - URL patterns

# 2. Create API endpoints
# apps/approvals/serializers.py - DRF Serializers (if using)
# apps/approvals/api_views.py - API endpoints

# 3. Test email + SSH flow
python manage.py shell
>>> from apps.approvals.models import Approval, RatingSchedule
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> from datetime import timedelta

# Create approval (auto-triggers email via signal)
>>> approval = Approval.objects.create(
...     server_name='test-server',
...     server_port=1425,
...     rating_schedule=RatingSchedule.objects.first(),
...     email_recipients=['test@example.com'],
...     scheduled_time=timezone.now() + timedelta(hours=1),
...     deadline=timezone.now() + timedelta(days=1),
... )

# Approve (auto-triggers SSH + confirmation email)
>>> approval.status = 'approved'
>>> approval.approved_by = 'admin@example.com'
>>> approval.save()
```
